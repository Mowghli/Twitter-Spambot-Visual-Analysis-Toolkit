2478087467,Sun Jul 05 03:48:54 +0000 2009,I'm out.
2478083303,Sun Jul 05 03:48:27 +0000 2009,Got to double up to stay competitive so got money in on QQ. Lost to AK when K hit.
2478058076,Sun Jul 05 03:45:58 +0000 2009,Caught a J and doubled up.
2477701968,Sun Jul 05 03:10:40 +0000 2009,Last hand before last break:  one pre flop raiser. I reraised. He pushed all in. I had pocket JJ. I called. He flipped over KK.
2477689577,Sun Jul 05 03:09:29 +0000 2009,Got crippled down to 8k. Still getting second best hands. Got outplayed once in bog pot.
2475982298,Sun Jul 05 00:16:55 +0000 2009,The Russian and I tangled for about three hours straight.
2475969104,Sun Jul 05 00:15:33 +0000 2009,Them there is the Russian. He was dangerous but he lost a huge hand to the norweigan. He's almost out.
2475955775,Sun Jul 05 00:14:09 +0000 2009,We have a guy who overslept and missed almost the entire first level.
2475951224,Sun Jul 05 00:13:39 +0000 2009,Then there is the blond woman from Norway. She breathes heavy when she has a good hand.
2475942002,Sun Jul 05 00:12:40 +0000 2009,There's a guy at the table who has only played 5 hands.
2475937248,Sun Jul 05 00:12:10 +0000 2009,Got to reevaulate strategy and make sure I don't get trapped being so aggressive and wild.
2475918482,Sun Jul 05 00:10:12 +0000 2009,But I didn't tilt at all and raised the next hand and continued playing. And that's worth something.
2475908374,Sun Jul 05 00:09:09 +0000 2009,Funny thing was the other guy in hand who folded on the turn had ace-Jack. We pushed him out of the hand. And he was not a fish.
2475897334,Sun Jul 05 00:07:57 +0000 2009,I was hoping I could push him off his hand. I figured he was on flush draw or had ace-six. He called and had ace-six.
2475887917,Sun Jul 05 00:06:58 +0000 2009,Back to that hand. Long story short I had two pair and flush draw on turn. Bet 8k and one caller. Q on river bet another 10k
2475705571,Sat Jul 04 23:48:21 +0000 2009,"Big hand:  had 5-6s.  Flop.  A 6 J. Checked around, 3 players."
2475535207,Sat Jul 04 23:30:48 +0000 2009,Blinds are 150/300
2475526888,Sat Jul 04 23:30:02 +0000 2009,Took big couple hits. Lost almost 40k in two hands. Have 22k now.
2474217417,Sat Jul 04 21:22:13 +0000 2009,Picked up a lot of premi hands bit not always good.
2474211714,Sat Jul 04 21:21:41 +0000 2009,Stack running between 27 and 34k. About 31k now. 30k starting.
2474204771,Sat Jul 04 21:21:03 +0000 2009,Lost a big pot with kk. Guy flopped quads. Lost another when trips hit and I was out kicked.
2474196119,Sat Jul 04 21:20:18 +0000 2009,I have a wild image. Players are saying I have no idea what you have and then fail to value bet me.

2466077318,Sat Jul 04 06:05:11 +0000 2009,Whenever there was a pro all in or something happening they ran over to the table and started filming. They would run back and forth.
2466064876,Sat Jul 04 06:03:46 +0000 2009,It was interesting to watch for a few minutes. Basically they had mobile crews with cameras walking through the majority of the tables.
2466050199,Sat Jul 04 06:02:05 +0000 2009,Well it was Gus hansen. He was like a rock star. Women were falling over themselves to get next to him.
2466018786,Sat Jul 04 05:58:28 +0000 2009,I was going by the ESOP before it started today and all of a sudden the hallway filled with people. Women were all excited and giggling.
