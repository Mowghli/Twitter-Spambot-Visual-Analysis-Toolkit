2009-11-29 01:38:32,@TinyKsass But I miss my boo though. I got to talk to you for like... 20 minutes today. :(
2009-11-29 01:37:45,@meow_mix85 HA! You can keep him. I got a 16 year old one I'm trying to put on the market.
2009-11-29 01:30:25,@TinyKsass I've been online too. And Ashley said she was talking to you on Myspace but somehow it didn't click. Fail.
2009-11-29 01:27:01,@TinyKsass Awww... I didn't call you because I thought you'd be sleeping. And now I'm talking to PBB on the house phone. Poo.
