2009-11-10 07:08:05,@draddee I'm pretty sure UK and Japan have the same songs. Japan's version's only released in Spring next year so we'll have to wait.
2009-11-10 07:08:37,@draddee What I'm really interested right now is MUSIC VIDS. OMG!!!!
2009-11-10 07:10:13,@draddee Oh you mean it's automatic downloads?!?! I didn't know!! Itunes newbie ===> me
2009-11-10 07:12:47,@draddee I think a happy medium between Robbie William's music vid and something acceptable by America will be ideal
