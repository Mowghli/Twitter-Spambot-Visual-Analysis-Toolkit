2009-11-25 23:19:52,@cvilledave Agreed! I hate his wife - that story is getting way played out. Focus on the kids; the wife story is overly stupid. #Glee
2009-11-25 22:40:58,@robwillb I do have to say that the final song/scene brought chills and tears though. Very well done - as always! :o)
2009-11-25 22:38:46,@robwillb Loved it as always but didn't take a top spot for me. Tho I may have still been distracted from gut-wrenching Criminal Minds ep :(
2009-11-25 22:37:56,@robwillb Why was tonight's Glee so special for you? Just curious.
