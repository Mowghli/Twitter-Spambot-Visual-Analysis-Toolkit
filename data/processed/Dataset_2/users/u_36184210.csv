2009-11-15 16:48:24,Real nice game thus far by Clay thus far.  Where would our D be without him?
2009-11-15 14:53:46,I thought that he was our best linebacker.  LOL.  I got pretty bashed in in PS for saying that he was a heavy SS that can't run fast.
2009-11-15 14:50:08,@Aaron_Nagler You mean I'm not the only person that thinks that Chillar is laughably bad agaisnt the run.
