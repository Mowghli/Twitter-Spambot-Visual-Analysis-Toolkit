2009-11-13 04:19:02,@alykhansatchu It had lost its mind but patience & analysis helps. U called it right. Only if market sees what we see. Therein lies the rub
2009-11-13 04:14:45,@alykhansatchu #Tea 2nd half skew will be huge.  And might continue into 1H 2010. Interesting times ahead. I envy you.
2009-11-13 04:10:10,@alykhansatchu KQ on a roll but wish cud exchange with ur #Tea stake. Cant find any. Looking for days! Missed large trade on prompt [sneaky]
2009-11-13 04:08:28,@alykhansatchu Looked at 2007-8 AR & ur right but all biological gain. But it might turn to real green this year. I prefer ur other stake
2009-11-13 04:02:32,@alykhansatchu EPS 0.68 thru 31 Mar unless u expect 2H EPS to jump 300% (possible...)
