2009-11-24 03:18:50,I think one reason a lot of people doesn't like lists is that it won't add to your follower count. People are ego centric.
2009-11-24 03:15:39,@nicksak I believe Seesmic has support for lists (at least in some platforms). TweetDeck will have soon. I'm sure others will too.
2009-11-24 03:14:43,@JesperBylund True. But it would also punish spam accounts. I think you're right though.
2009-11-24 03:11:08,"Actually, although twitter lists is a very recent feature I reach many more people that way than if I only count my followers."
2009-11-24 03:09:04,"I can see followers, native retweet and lists being used for a possible Twitterrank feature. What about age of Twitter account?"
