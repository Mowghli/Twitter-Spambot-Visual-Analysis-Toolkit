2009-11-12 21:59:11,@Daniel92380 sucks to be you.
2009-11-12 21:42:47,@Daniel92380 That's good. The only saw movie i didn't like was the first one. They've all been better than the last.
2009-11-12 21:29:44,@Daniel92380 yeah. I hope so. I would hate to waste money on a shit movie like we did on paranormal activity.
2009-11-12 21:25:08,@Daniel92380 hmm. . . Maybe lol. Have you seen saw vi?
