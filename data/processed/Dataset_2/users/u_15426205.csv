2009-11-22 16:55:07,Rented Star Trek (the new one) for tonight. This will be the second and a half time I've seen it. The family hasn't seen it yet.

2009-11-22 16:49:05,"So we (and by ""we"" I mean ""I"") installed it in the parking lot. It's 20ft³ of extra cargo space. With seats up the Durango only has 20.1ft³."
