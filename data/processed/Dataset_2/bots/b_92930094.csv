2010-02-14 14:47:40,Ok.. tmobile is trying to bill me $16.88 for a 43 min call to Canada (39cents/min) for VOIP call (not cell) and they cant prevent intl calls
2010-02-14 14:54:19,Marcus (ID#0653656) is the rep at Tmobile who is telling me I need to check every number I call to make sure it's not in Canada. Sounds fun.
