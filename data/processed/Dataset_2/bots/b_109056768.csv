2010-01-27 15:14:50,I'm learning about twitter and this is my very first tweet!
2010-01-27 16:08:40,I am looking forward to my trip to Florida in 2wks and will be there for 6 weeks.  Plan to spend time in Fort Myers beach and Tampa Bay.
2010-01-27 17:12:22,@FredLacey do you support the current bills?  As an RN Im really disappointed with the way the democrats worked on this behind closed doors.
2010-01-27 17:16:40,@BradleySRees Yes will watch it but suspect it will be all talk and little meaningful action.  Another bait & switch with gov. spend freeze.
2010-01-27 17:22:33,@owendbanks the Dems are tone deaf and blind.  They continue to ignore the election results & what the average citizen has to say.
