2009-11-20 02:29:24,@fourzerotwo so many teddies on high rise. Cool spot
2009-12-12 21:42:40,@fourzerotwo mate any word on getting the same match making fix for xbox like they did on ps3? Frustrating spending all day in red bar games
2010-01-09 16:53:13,@fourzerotwo how can dlc be your focus? Fix the match making for international xbox users. Why bring out new stuff for something unplayable.
2010-01-10 22:09:43,@fourzerotwo Local matchmaking! Where is it? Way more important than DLC! Should be main priority unless you only want USA to play? SADTIMES
