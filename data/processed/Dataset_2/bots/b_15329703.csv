2009-05-03 23:37:17,@CariCanary Yeah the D90 is an awesome camera. The 18-135 is a good wide angle lens which I am selling and also the fisheye is pretty crazy.

2009-05-03 23:55:55,@CariCanary  I like the fish better than the sigma for sure. Better glass and what not. The 50 is an awesome lens too. All perfect condition
